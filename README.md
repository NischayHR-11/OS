## Overview

Operating Systems are the backbone of computer systems, managing hardware resources and providing services for software applications. This repository covers essential topics such as process management, memory management, file systems, synchronization, and more.

Through a combination of theoretical explanations and practical implementations, this project aims to bridge the gap between OS theory and real-world application.

## Key Features

- **Process Management**: Learn about processes, threads, CPU scheduling, and inter-process communication.
- **Memory Management**: Explore paging, segmentation, virtual memory, and memory allocation strategies.
- **File Systems**: Understand the structure, design, and implementation of file systems.
- **Concurrency and Synchronization**: Dive into concepts like semaphores, mutexes, deadlocks, and multi-threading.
- **System-Level Programming**: Hands-on projects that implement key OS components and simulate OS behavior.

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized to facilitate easy navigation and understanding of the OS concepts:

- **docs/**: Comprehensive documentation, including theoretical concepts and tutorials.
- **tests/**: Test cases and unit tests to validate the OS implementations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the code and projects in this repository, you need:

- **C/C++ Compiler**: Most of the OS-level programming is done in C/C++.
- **Make**: For building the projects.
- **Linux Environment**: Recommended for a real-world OS development experience.

### Running the Projects

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NischayHR-11/OS.git
   cd OS
   ```

2. **Build the project**:
   Navigate to the specific directory (e.g., `src/processes`) and use `make` to build the project:
   ```bash
   cd src/processes
   make
   ```

3. **Run the project**:
   After building, execute the binary to see the project in action:
   ```bash
   ./process_simulation
   ```

4. **Testing**:
   Run the tests to ensure everything works as expected:
   ```bash
   cd tests
   make test
   ```

## Projects and Exercises

This repository includes various projects and exercises to solidify your understanding:

- **Process Scheduler Simulation**: Implement and test different CPU scheduling algorithms.
- **Memory Allocator**: Design a simple memory allocator using techniques like paging and segmentation.
- **File System Emulator**: Build a basic file system emulator that handles file creation, deletion, and organization.
- **Multithreading and Synchronization**: Implement multithreaded programs using semaphores and mutexes to handle race conditions.

Each project is accompanied by detailed instructions and explanations to guide you through the implementation.
